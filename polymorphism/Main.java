Polymorphism :- Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
                Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many
                and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.

                There are two types of polymorphism in Java:
                
                1.Compile-time polymorphism (static polymorphism):- 
                This type of polymorphism in Java is also called static polymorphism . 
                It can be achieved by method Overloading. 
                Compile-time polymorphism is handled by Compiler.

                2.Runtime polymorphism (Dynamic polymorphism):- 
                This type of polymorphism in Java is also called Dynamic polymorphism . 
                It can be achieved by method Overriding. 
                Runtime polymorphism is handled by JVM.
