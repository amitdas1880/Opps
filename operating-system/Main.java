1.Operating System :-
--> Operating System (OS) is basically a software program that manages and handles all resources 
    of a computer such as hardware and software.
--> The first OS was introduced in the early 1950s known as GMOs. 
--> It  manages computer memory, processes, operation of all hardware and software.
--> Operating System is to execute user programs and make it easier to understand for the user.
--> It provides an environment for the development and execution of programs.
--> Eg:- i.Microsoft Windows 
        ii.Apple macOS.
       iii.Google Android OS.
        vi.Linux Operating System.

Functions of Operating System :-
There are many functions of the OS. Some of the important functions of OS are given below:

--> Memory and Processor Management.
--> Providing user interface.
--> File Management and Device Management.
--> Scheduling of resources.
--> Error Detection.
--> Security.

Types of Operating System :-

1.Batched OS (Example: Payroll System, Transactions Process, etc.)
2.Multi-Programmed OS (Example: Windows O/S, Linux O/S, etc.)
3.Timesharing OS (Example: Multics, etc.)
4.Distributed OS (LOCUS, etc.)
5.Real-Time OS (PSOS, VRTX, etc.)

2.Memory :-
Main memory-: 
--> Main memory in a computer is RAM (Random Access Memory). It is also known as primary memory or 
    read-write memory or internal memory.
--> The programs and data that the CPU requires during the execution of a program are stored in this memory.

Secondary memory:-
--> Secondary memory in a computer are storage devices that can store data and programs.
    It is also known as external memory or additional memory or backup memory or auxiliary memory.
--> Such storage devices are capable of storing high-volume data.
--> Storage devices can be hard drives, Pen drive, CDs etc. 

3.What is GUI?
--> GUI (Graphical User Interface) is basically a type of user interface that allows users to 
    use graphics to interact with OS.
--> GUI is created because it is more user-friendly, less complex, and easier to understand .
    Its main goal is to increase efficiency and ease of use.
--> Examples of GUI include Microsoft Windows, macOS, Apple’s iOS, etc.

4.Multiprocessor System:-
--> A Multiprocessor system is a processer which includes two or more CPUs with single sharing memory space.
--> It involves the processing of different computer programs at the same time.

Advantage of multiprocesser System :-
--> By increasing the number of processors, a greater number of tasks can be completed in unit time.
--> It simply improves the reliability of the computer system.
--> It improves the performance of the System by running multiple programs.

5.What is a bootstrap program in OS?
--> It is a program that is executed whenever computer system startups. 
--> OS is loaded through a bootstrapping process or program commonly known as booting.
--> Overall OS only depends on the bootstrap program to perform and work correctly.
--> It is fully stored in boot blocks at a fixed location on the disk.
--> It also locates the kernel and loads it into the main memory after which the program starts its execution.

6.What is a process?
--> The process is basically a program that is currently under execution.
--> The main function of an OS is to manage and handle all of these processes.
--> When a program is loaded into the memory and it becomes a process, 
    it can be divided into four sections ─ stack, heap, text, and data.

There are two types of processes:- 
1.Operating System Processes
2.User Processes

7.Process State :- 

8.Virtual Memory :- 
--> Virtual memory is very useful feature in Memory Management Technique.
--> It is simply space where a greater number of programs can be stored in the form of pages.
--> It enables us to increase the use of physical memory by using a disk and 
    also allows us to have memory protection. 
--> It can be managed in two common ways by OS 
        i. paging 
       ii.segmentation
--> It acts as temporary storage that can be used along with RAM for computer processes.

9.What is the difference between paging and segmentation?
Paging:-
--> It is feature  of memory management technique .
--> It allows Operating System to retrieve processes from secondary storage into main memory. 
--> It is a non-contiguous allocation technique that divides each process in the form of pages. 

Segmentation:- 
--> It is feature of memory management technique.
--> It divides processes into modules and parts of different sizes. 
--> These parts and modules are known as segments that can be allocated to process.

10.What is Demand Paging ?
--> Demand paging is a method that loads pages into memory on demand. 
--> This method is mostly used in virtual memory. 
--> A page is only brought into memory when a location on that particular page is referenced during execution. 

Socket:-
--> A socket is used to make connection between two applications/programs. 
    Endpoints of the connection are called socket.

What is thrashing in OS?
--> when system spends an execessive amount of time, swapping data between physical memory (RAM)
    and virtual memory due to high memory demand and low available resources.
 
Overlays :-
--> Overlays is basically a programming method which divides the processes into pieces.
--> It can run programs that are bigger in size than physical memory keeped only important data 
    and instructions and that can be stored in the memory. 
--> It does not need any type of support from the OS. 

Context Switching :- 
--> The  context switching is a technique which is used by the Operating system.
--> In context switching the Operating system switch the processes from one state to another state 
    for it's execution .
--> A context switching helps to share a single CPU across all processes to complete it's execution.

What is a Scheduling Algorithm?
--> A scheduling is a process that is used to improve efficiency, by utilizing maximum CPU and 
    providing minimum waiting time to tasks.
--> It simply deals with the problem of deciding which of outstanding requests is to be allocated resources.


Thread in OS :- 
--> It is a basic unit of CPU utilization.
--> It makes communication more effective and efficient.
--> It enables utilization of multiprocessor and reduces the time required in context switching. 
--> Thread is a path of execution that is composed of a program counter, thread id, stack,
    and set of registers within the process.
    
Dead lock in OS :- 
--> Deadlock is generally a situation where two or more processes are blocked each other process.
--> In this situation, two or more processes simply try to execute simultaneously and 
    wait for each to finish their execution because they are dependent on each other for their resources.
    
What is Kernel and write its main functions?
--> kernel is the part of Operating system (OS).
--> It is lower layer of OS .
--> kernel acts as interface between hardware and processer of the computer.
--> kernel loads first in memory after Operating system has been loaded and remains in the memory until 
    Operating system is shutdown.
    
function of kernel :- 
  i. Device management
 ii. Memory management
iii. Task management

Types of kernal :- 
1. Monolithic Kernel
2. MicroKernel
3. Hybrid Kernel 
4. Nano Kernel
5. Exo Kernel

What is Fragmentation?
--> Fragmentation is a phenomenon of memory wastage. It reduces the capacity and performance of CPU 
    because space is used inefficiently.
    
Types of Fragmentation:- 
Internal fragmentation: It is occurred when we deal with the systems that have fixed size allocation units.
External fragmentation: It is occurred when we deal with systems that have variable-size allocation units.


What is the difference between multitasking and multiprocessing OS?
Multitasking:- 
--> It is a system that allows more efficient use of computer hardware.
--> This system works on more than one task at one time by rapidly switching between various tasks.
--> These systems are also known as time-sharing systems. 

Multiprocessing:- 
--> It is a system that allows multiple or various processors in a computer to process 
    two or more different portions of the same program simultaneously.
--> It is used to complete more work in a shorter period of time.
