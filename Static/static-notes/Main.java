What is Static variable ?

When a variable is declared Static in a java program , it means that there is only
one copy of the variable in the memory.Regardless of how many instance of  the class are created.
In static method, it can be called without creating any instance of the class.

/*Note - INSTANCE :- When we create an object of the class we can create the instance of the class.
*/
/* Note :- if we write (static) then we can't write (this) keyword. 
           > static is not associated with object means the object is not able to change it.
           > static is associated with class variable.
           > we can't call non-static member from static.
